# parallel-oct-tree

instructions:
look in function/ directory, there are lots of cool functions there, I have all the Platonic solids, texture mapping, etc...
make ISOFUNCTION=function/gear_8_18.i

in the viewer:
space - save model as obj, you have to wait for the model to be fully constructed
v - use vertex buffer viz, much faster
esc - exit program
